# Research Writer: Agent-Assisted Academic Research Workflow
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/kurtvalcorza/research-writer)

A modular system for rigorous academic, policy, and R&D research through a structured multi-phase workflow. Features literature discovery, synthesis, argument structuring, and drafting with built-in quality control checkpoints. Includes both CLI and production-ready web interface (Next.js, React 19, TypeScript) with visual dashboard and real-time execution monitoring.

# Transcribe Audio with OpenAI Whisper
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kurtvalcorza/notebooks/blob/main/Transcribe_Audio_Whisper.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates how to transcribe audio files using OpenAI's Whisper model via the whisper Python package. It supports common audio formats (e.g., MP3, WAV) and provides a simple pipeline for uploading, transcribing, and saving transcripts.

# Audio Diarization with `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kurtvalcorza/notebooks/blob/main/speech_to_text_diarization.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates how to perform audio diarization using OpenAI's `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize` model. It takes an audio file as input, processes it in chunks, and generates a diarized transcript, identifying different speakers in the audio. Obtain an OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

# H2O Flow in Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kurtvalcorza/notebooks/blob/main/H2O_Flow_Google_Colab.ipynb)

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to setting up and accessing H2O Flow within a Google Colab environment. It installs necessary dependencies, initializes the H2O server, and uses localtunnel to create a public URL for the H2O Flow web interface, allowing users to interact with H2O's machine learning capabilities directly from Colab.
