# H2O Flow in Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kurtvalcorza/notebooks/blob/main/H2O_Flow_Google_Colab.ipynb)

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to setting up and accessing H2O Flow within a Google Colab environment. It installs necessary dependencies, initializes the H2O server, and uses localtunnel to create a public URL for the H2O Flow web interface, allowing users to interact with H2O's machine learning capabilities directly from Colab.
